          Coordination and control mechanisms hinder agile work. As a result, established companies lose market share to innovative startups. Corporate venturing allows your company to invest in new strategically relevant business models with top entrepreneurs who have fresh ideas and a different approach to a specific market. Thus you gain competitive advantages such as specialist knowledge in the core business (R&D), gather new know-how regarding processes and partner models (M&A), open up new business opportunities and much more.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy measure">
          There are a number of possible approaches a business can take to corporate venturing. We at the SWISS STARTUP GROUP are familiar with all aspects of the corporate venturing landscape and know the business from scratch. We are experts in this field and with our specialized startup know-how, experience and our growth services we strive to provide the most suitable strategies paired with the best service you can find.
