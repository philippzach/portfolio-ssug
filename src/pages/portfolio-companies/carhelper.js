        paragraph="Carhelper.ch is the largest Swiss comparison and booking platform for car service and repairs. What makes Carhelper unique is a sophisticated algorithm that combines data from the Federal Roads Office (ASTRA), vehicle manufacturers and partner workshops. The customer thus not only receives the best price, but also a recommendation as to which maintenance work should be carried out on his car with the appropriate age and mileage. Itâ€™s like booking.com but for cars."
